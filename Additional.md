How would you change the architecture to scale ?
To scale the architecture for handling larger volumes of requests or more intensive processing, I could use:

Load Balancer: Deploy multiple instances of my application and use a load balancer to distribute incoming requests evenly across these instances.
Auto-Scaling: Implement auto-scaling groups (e.g., AWS Auto Scaling) to automatically adjust the number of running instances based on current traffic and load.

Additionally, I could leverage Celery with Redis for distributed task processing like i did while building this project:
Celery with Redis: Will use celery to manage distributed task queues, with Redis as the message broker. This setup enables parallel execution of image recognition tasks by multiple celery workers, improving throughput and efficiency.


How to actually implement the OCR part yourself instead of using tesseract?
Custom Model Training: By using TensorFlow or PyTorch to develop a custom OCR model with architectures like CRNN or Transformer-based models for improved accuracy.
Pretrained Models: Alternatively, it'll be a better option to use fine-tuned pretrained models from libraries like Hugging Faceâ€™s Transformers or OpenCV DNN module to speed up development
